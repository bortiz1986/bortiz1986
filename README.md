### Hi there, my name is Bernandina A.K.A Lina👋

## ❗Introduction
I currently live in San Diego with my husband and two kiddos.  I have a B.S. in Computer Engineering from CSULB. I started my career as a VHDL developer back in 2010. I did freelancing webdevelopment for two years from 2013 to 2015. Then in 2015 I started working for a major defence company in Saint Louis, Missouri where I was a C++ developer and was able to work on a lot of cool things. I am currently working in another big defence company out in San Diego where I get to provide the software that help the people that protect this contry do their job. My husband and I are currently trying our side hustle, that has been on the drawing board for the past 10 years, Apetech LLC.  Check us out!  [Apetech LLC](https://apetech.me/)
